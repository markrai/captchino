# Captchino v1.1.0

AI-assisted Steps & Solution for any programming language.

## Highlights

- Screen capture with AI analysis
  - Works with both OpenAI and Gemini accounts
- Advanced Stealth Features
  - Hidden from the taskbar, system tray, and alt+tab
  - Always stays in secondary monitor, with hotkey to hide completely
- Stable, unlike other platforms which overpromise, and underdeliver

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11
- An API key for either (or both):
  - Google Gemini (https://aistudio.google.com)
  - OpenAI API (https://openai.com/api/)

## Getting Started

1. Run the app
   - Launch `Captchino.exe`. The app starts on the secondary monitor (if present) and avoids the taskbar & system tray.

2. Enter your API key(s)
   - Open Settings and paste either an OpenAI or a Gemini key. You can switch providers and models anytime.
   - We recommend Gemini gemini-2.0-flash and OpenAI gpt-4.1.

3. Activation
   - Offline activation: Use "Generate Code" in Settings to produce a device code. Share it with us at register@captchino.com to receive a Registration Key for that machine, once you have made payment.
   - Demos are available upon request. Email us at help@captchino.com
